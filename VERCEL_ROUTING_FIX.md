# 🔧 Vercel Routing Fix - SPA 404 Issue

## 🐛 Problem

When refreshing pages like `/invoices` or `/inventory` on Vercel, you get a 404 error.

**Why?** Vercel tries to find a physical file at that path, but in a Single Page Application (SPA), all routes are handled by the client-side router (Wouter in this case).

---

## ✅ Solution Applied

### 1. **Updated `vercel.json`**

Changed the rewrites configuration to properly redirect all routes to `index.html`:

```json
{
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

**What this does:**
- Catches all routes (`(.*)` = any path)
- Redirects them to `/index.html`
- Your React app then handles the routing

### 2. **Restored `vite.config.ts` Build Settings**

Added back the build configuration:

```typescript
build: {
  outDir: path.resolve(import.meta.dirname, "dist/public"),
  emptyOutDir: true,
}
```

## 🚀 Deploy the Fix

### Option 1: Git Push (Automatic)

```bash
cd "/run/media/kashifmehmood/64A19375084CBA56/Web Projects/IMS/StockFlowPro"

git add vercel.json vite.config.ts
git commit -m "Fix: Vercel SPA routing - redirect all routes to index.html"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will automatically redeploy with the fix.

### Option 2: Manual Redeploy

1. Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Deployments**
4. Click **"Redeploy"** on the latest deployment
5. Or push the changes via Git

---

## 🧪 Testing After Deployment

1. Visit your Vercel URL: `https://your-app.vercel.app`
2. Navigate to `/invoices`
3. **Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)**
4. ✅ Page should load correctly (no 404)
5. Test other routes:
   - `/inventory`
   - `/dashboard`
   - `/invoice/[id]`

## 📋 How It Works

### **Before Fix:**
```
User visits: https://your-app.vercel.app/invoices
User refreshes
↓
Vercel looks for: /invoices/index.html
↓
File not found → 404 Error
```

### **After Fix:**
```
User visits: https://your-app.vercel.app/invoices
User refreshes
↓
Vercel rewrites to: /index.html
↓
React app loads
↓
Wouter router handles /invoices route
↓
✅ Correct page displays
```

## 🔍 Alternative Solutions (Not Needed)

If the above doesn't work, here are alternatives:

### **Option A: Use `routes` instead of `rewrites`**

```json
{
  "routes": [
    {
      "handle": "filesystem"
    },
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

### **Option B: Add `cleanUrls` and `trailingSlash`**

```json
{
  "cleanUrls": true,
  "trailingSlash": false,
  "rewrites": [
    {
      "source": "/(.*)",
      "destination": "/index.html"
    }
  ]
}
```

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### **Still Getting 404?**

1. **Check Build Output:**
   - Ensure `dist/public/index.html` exists after build
   - Run `npm run build` locally to verify

2. **Check Vercel Build Logs:**
   - Go to Vercel Dashboard → Deployments
   - Click on latest deployment
   - Check build logs for errors

3. **Verify Output Directory:**
   - In Vercel project settings
   - Check "Output Directory" is set to `dist/public`

4. **Clear Vercel Cache:**
   - In Vercel Dashboard
   - Settings → General
   - Scroll to "Build & Development Settings"
   - Click "Clear Cache"
   - Redeploy

### **Routes Still Not Working?**

Check your router configuration in the app:

```typescript
// client/src/App.tsx or main router file
import { Route, Switch } from 'wouter';

// Ensure all routes are defined
<Switch>
  <Route path="/" component={Home} />
  <Route path="/invoices" component={Invoices} />
  <Route path="/inventory" component={Inventory} />
  <Route path="/invoice/:id" component={ViewInvoice} />
  <Route path="/dashboard" component={Dashboard} />
  {/* 404 fallback */}
  <Route component={NotFound} />
</Switch>
```
