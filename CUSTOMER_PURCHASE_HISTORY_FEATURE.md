```typescript
const totalPurchases = filteredInvoices.reduce((sum, inv) => sum + inv.total_amount, 0);
const totalPaid = filteredInvoices.reduce((sum, inv) => sum + inv.amount_paid, 0);
const totalDue = filteredInvoices.reduce((sum, inv) => sum + inv.remaining_due, 0);
const purchaseCount = filteredInvoices.length;
```
