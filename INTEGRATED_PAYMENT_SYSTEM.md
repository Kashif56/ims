# Integrated Customer Payment System

## Overview
Completely redesigned the customer payment system to be integrated directly into the Customers page with invoice selection capability.

## What Changed

### ❌ Removed
- **Old Route**: `/customer-payments` page (removed from routing)
- **Old Component**: `CustomerPaymentHistory.tsx` page (replaced)
- **Navigation Button**: "Customer Pay" button from main navigation

### ✅ New Implementation
- **Modal-Based View**: Payment history opens as a modal overlay from Customers page
- **Invoice Selection**: Can record payments for specific invoices/bills
- **Integrated Experience**: No page navigation needed - everything in one place

## New Features

### 1. **Modal Payment View**
Opens directly from Customers page when clicking "View Payment History" button:
- **Full-screen modal** with customer details
- **Payment history** displayed in timeline format
- **Quick stats**: Current due, total paid, unpaid invoices count
- **Add Payment** button prominently displayed

### 2. **Smart Payment Recording**

#### Payment Type Selection
When adding a payment, user chooses:
- **General Payment**: Regular payment not tied to specific invoice
- **Payment for Invoice/Bill**: Payment for a specific invoice

#### Invoice Selection (When "Payment for Invoice" is selected)
- **Dropdown list** of unpaid invoices
- Shows **invoice number** and **remaining due amount**
- Only shows invoices with `remaining_due > 0`
- Displays selected invoice's due amount below dropdown

#### Payment Processing
**For General Payments:**
- Records in `payment_history` with type `'due_payment'`
- Reduces customer's `current_due` balance
- No invoice linkage

**For Invoice Payments:**
- Records in `payment_history` with type `'invoice_payment'`
- Links to specific invoice via `invoice_id`
- Updates invoice's `amount_paid` and `remaining_due`
- Reduces customer's `current_due` balance
- Auto-generates note with invoice number

## User Flow

### Viewing Payment History
1. Navigate to **Customers** page
2. Find customer (card or list view)
3. Click **"View Payment History"** button or History icon
4. Modal opens showing:
   - Customer name and phone

   - Complete payment history
   - "Add Payment" button

## Technical Details

### New Component: `CustomerPaymentView.tsx`
**Location**: `client/src/components/CustomerPaymentView.tsx`

**Props:**
- `customer`: Customer object
- `onClose`: Callback to close modal
- `onPaymentRecorded`: Callback after successful payment

**Features:**
- Fetches payment history and invoices on mount
- Real-time data refresh after payment
- Form validation
- Error handling with toast notifications
- Loading states

### New API Function: `getInvoicesByCustomer()`
**Location**: `client/src/lib/supabaseService.ts`

```typescript
export const getInvoicesByCustomer = async (customerId: string)
```

Fetches all invoices for a specific customer, ordered by creation date.

### New API Function: `updateInvoice()`
**Location**: `client/src/lib/supabaseService.ts`

```typescript
export const updateInvoice = async (id: string, updates: Partial<Invoice>)
```

Updates invoice fields (used for updating `amount_paid` and `remaining_due`).

### Database Operations

#### When Recording General Payment:
1. **Insert** into `payment_history`:
   - `customer_id`: Customer ID
   - `customer_name`: Customer name
   - `amount`: Payment amount
   - `payment_type`: 'due_payment'
   - `invoice_id`: NULL
   - `notes`: User notes or default

2. **Update** `customers` table:
   - `current_due` = `current_due - amount`

#### When Recording Invoice Payment:
1. **Update** `invoices` table:
   - `amount_paid` = `amount_paid + amount`
   - `remaining_due` = `total_amount - amount_paid`

2. **Insert** into `payment_history`:
   - `customer_id`: Customer ID
   - `customer_name`: Customer name
   - `amount`: Payment amount
   - `payment_type`: 'invoice_payment'
   - `invoice_id`: Selected invoice ID
   - `notes`: User notes or "Payment for invoice {number}"

3. **Update** `customers` table:
   - `current_due` = `current_due - amount`

## UI/UX Improvements

### Modal Design
- **Full-screen overlay**: Dark background, centered modal
- **Responsive**: Works on mobile and desktop
- **Scrollable content**: Payment history scrolls independently
- **Easy close**: X button and "Close" button at bottom

### Visual Hierarchy
- **Large stats cards**: Current due, total paid, unpaid invoices
- **Timeline-style history**: Each payment in a card with date/time
- **Color-coded badges**: Green (invoice), Yellow (partial), Blue (due)
- **Prominent CTA**: "Add Payment" button stands out

### Form Design
- **Step-by-step**: Payment type → Invoice (if applicable) → Amount → Notes
- **Contextual help**: Shows current due and invoice due amounts
- **Validation**: Real-time validation with error messages
- **Loading states**: Disabled inputs and "Recording..." text

## Benefits
